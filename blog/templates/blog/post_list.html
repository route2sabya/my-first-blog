<h2><a href="">Discovering South India – I</a></h2>
<p> It’s been a week since I returned from a long journey spanning over two weeks and countless kilometres. It couldn’t have come on a better time. I start my dissertation next semester and implications of this could be huge. With a gush of ideas I feel renewed.</p>

<p>While there was a certain sense that things would eventually round up to a perspective after this long a trip, I wasn’t really sure How? I had only once stepped into the territory of Tamil Nadu previously. This was when I was travelling from Trivandrum to Kanyakumari. Only image I recall from that is of the numerous hoardings of the then CM Jayalalitha and of beautiful tiny shops selling Bharatnatyam masks. There were a fair number of people on the streets. The entire landscape gave an image of a busy picturesque locale.</p>

<p>I boarded my train from Delhi on a hot summer morning. I had a friend accompanying me. It was a long journey all the way to Madurai. Which could have been an otherwise ‘exhausting two days’, proved crucial in developing a temperament for the trip. We were surrounded by Tamil families. The dialect is unique. A peculiar stretch denotes an end to every sentence. However, what captured my attention were the songs (probably from some recent Tamil movie), only getting louder as we neared the destination.  As we passed fields after fields of jasmine flowers aligned with coconut trees, one of the passengers, noticing us gawking in awe, was generous enough to tell us how as a child he would collect and sell these flowers every morning before school time to make some money. Small villages kept coming and going. A scene straight out of the Malgudi Days it seemed.</p>

<h3><a href="">MEENAKSHI TEMPLE</a></h3>

<p>We reached Madurai just in time. We were three by now. No, just that another friend of ours joined us in Vijayawada. The station took us right into the heart of the temple city. We were greeted by pretty Tamil ladies laden with gold in the form of hoardings that occupied much of the entire wall space around the station. The busy bustling town was oozing with life. The streets were alive with as many as people as activities. We found a budget hotel walking distance from both the station and the Meenakshi temple complex. As soon as we settled we set forth for the temple. The first glimpse of the gopuram (the entrance gate) gave an image of a live temple. It stood with an authority, effortlessly declaring itself to be the focal point, anchoring the world outside towards itself.</p>

<p>We queued up and got inside only to realise that we have to go around the premises towards the southern gopuram to go further inside. There are 14 gopurams in all. The outside four being the tallest and the most prominent. The carvings on these gopurams are extremely intricate and seem fierce at the same time.</p>

<p>After reaching the southern entrance, it was time to enter the inner complex. To go further inside we had to descend a few stairs to land onto a depressed level which one doesn’t really notice (probably because of the expanse of this level). It becomes the new reference level and the transition is subtle. On the right one can observe a large pond – open to sky and acting as a virtual sink providing relief to the heavy sanctum that lies right in the front. The effect is strong and immediate but not overwhelming.</p>

<p>My right side of the mind was at a constant conflict trying to understand the layout in front of me. Having already been around half the premises I should have probably deciphered it by now, at least the ‘expanse’ of it. But this was not the case. I  was still striving to make sense of it. This was the reason why I could only appreciate the play of solid-void and light-shadow to an extent and why the previously mentioned pond effect also couldn’t come into its own.</p>

<p>The pond had a certain static quality about it which seemed to counter the flow of movement. I went ahead. The carvings and the stone work looked heavy but due to the presence of enough natural light didn’t feel much dominating.</p>

<p>Then someone signalled me to join the queue on my left to enter the main Meenakshi shrine.What could have been an interesting exercise of concealment and revelation was reduced to a futile routine because of security procedures. It was interesting for me to find out that the main shrine didn’t lie on any major axis in the complex. Was it a deliberate intent or a later addition, I am not sure. However, it was quite unexpected and made me still more unclear about the entire scheme of things.</p>

<p>Once inside we observed an ambulatory and an inner sanctum. The volume felt extremely heavy and without natural light it felt ever so dominating. We entered the queue for entering the sanctum, and it was not before half an hour that we got a chance to go inside. One could see the relief on the faces of the devotees inside. We ourselves got a glimpse of the deity kept inside the ‘garbhagriha’ (inner womb sanctum).The negative space inside was at its reflective best. One can’t help but craft a narrative by carefully associating what he has experienced until now. The realisation can send chills up one’s spine. However the artificial lighting was shoddy and was a distraction at best.</p>

<p>Once coming out of the Meenakshi shrine another ambulatory unfolded, this one much larger and felt more airy. The proportions seemed appreciable and vents were provided for natural light. We went around it and were lead to the entry of  this other shrine, I was told to be Sundareswarar Shrine. A gold plated dhwaja stambha along with other much more intricately carved figures stood at the entrance. A clear axis lead to this entrance. However, by now, we were completely disoriented. Not realising in which direction to go further, we followed the axis all the way out through the eastern gate.</p>

<p>We went back inside, again through the southern gate. This time just to make sense of the entire layout which had clearly got the better of us the previous time. We followed a different path and were able to somehow understand as to how the two shrines were laid out, both facing the eastern side and placed adjacent to each other, one twice as large as the other one.</p>

<p>What we left with was a complex but a rich image, open to different interpretations and divided versions. An experience so highly based on the syntax of spaces , that merely entering from a different gate and following a different sequence of spaces can easily reduce the above interpretation as just one of the many different versions.</p>

<p>That night I went to the temple one last time to have a look at the ceremonies that take place every night. This was a chance for me to not observe the temple as an outsider but participate in the proceedings. It was a chance for me to find out whether this functional part could have an implication on my assessment. It was 9:30. The idol of goddess Meenakshi was being adorned in anticipation of Lord Shiva. The idol was brought. Everyone stood at one side, gave way, then sat and waited till the curtains drew. What trickled down me was a sense indescribable. I stood there fixated till everyone left!</p>

<h2><a href="">Let us learn to use the tap again</a></h2>
<p>One out of every nine people on the globe suffer from severe water shortage and its effects.
The above statistics contradict each other in terms of water availability.</p>
<p>For a world, with ever growing population, we need a highly evolved civilization that understands the the importance of water. The limited fresh water resources available in the depleted reserves should be used efficiently to meet the demands for all. Efficient water usage can be achieved through reduced water wastage, reusing through down cycling and recycling water.</p>
<p>The project envisages to guide the user towards a conscious water usage pattern which is very important for the existence of human race.</p>
<p>The world has mad giant leaps towards sustainability and more sustainable products are designed and manufactured today than ever. Yet, the landfills are increasing, groundwater tables are depleting, zero energy building residents are generating more waste then the rural schools, and the common man fails to adapt to the core belief of their sustainable and Eco-friendly products. The project revolves around bridging this gap between the common man and the water conscious lifestyle and the products through a simple sanitary fitting designed to be installed or retro-fitted to a new or already existing wash basin respectively.</p>

<p>A wash basin is the most frequently used sanitary device both in public as well as in private realms. An ordinary activity like brushing teeth can consume a minimum of 14 liters( 2 minutes of running tap water at 7lpm) through standard faucets( 8lpm). Reducing the flow of water to a healthy minimum of 4lpm (water sense technology prescribed flow rate) can reduce the wastage by a minimum of 6 liters in 2 minutes. (42.8% reduction in water use). In a family of four, the yearly savings on daily tooth brushing stands at a minimum of 8500 liters which is roughly the amount of water required for a family of four to sustain 20 odd days in a city like Bengaluru. Another common activity like hand washing which is practiced for a minimum of 12 times a day( CDC survey facts including pre and post meal hygiene and sanitary hygiene) uses approximately a minimum of 14 liters of water per individual per day( 2 minutes effective running water at 7lpm through a standard 8lpm faucet). Reducing the rate of flow of water to 4lpm can reduce the wastage of water by 6 liters. In a family of four, the annual water saving figures for hand washing stands at a minimum of 8500 liters. Face washing as a daily activity which is practiced at least once a day uses a minimum of 3.5 liters of water per individual( at 7lpm through standard 8lpm faucets). Reducing the flow of water to 4lpm can reduce the wastage by 1.5 liters every time we wash our face. In a family of four, the annual water savings on face washing stands at 2190 liters. A wash basin is the most versatile sanitary device that is used by the users for various activities apart from tooth brushing, hand washing and face washing, such as hair washing, cleaning ink spills, occasional dish washing, etc. The minimum annual water saving figures for a family of four is given by 19200 liters (approx) which is a 40% savings on the existing water use pattern.</p>

<p>A commonly observed behavior was taken as an inspiration for injecting the stimuli on the design of the wash basin. A behavioral intervention by the sanitary fitting for the user creates a momentary dialogue between the wash basin, faucet, user and water. The dialogue guides the user towards an efficient (reduced) rate of flow of water.</p>
<p>Most of us belonging to the current generation are acquainted to the tap since our early school days. Tap operating mechanism are too simple and obvious for the modern man to use logic into. But, this is where the intricacies come into play. The rate of flow of water, its relation to the tap operating mechanism and the users requirement cannot be worked out accurately by the human brain and hence instinct plays a larger role towards the determining of the rate of flow of water used. Another similar example that involves highly complex physical phenomena and calculation to induce logic is bicycling. Hence, we train our instincts to balance the movement and rather not calculate and balance the different forces that come into play while taking a turn, e.g gyroscopic forces.</p>
<p>Every time we turn on the tap in a hurry or subconsciously, we let our instinct  choose the rate of the flow of water and not the more justified 'logic'. Our instincts are majorly guided by the environmental stimuli that we receive from our surroundings and hence spilling water from the basin surface is one of the cues that determines the rate of flow of water we use, as we tend to stop and reduce the flow of water again to achieve a comfortable  flow without spillage. Another important factor which decides the rate of flow of water used is the relation between the tap operating torque and the force exerted by the users through their arm and fingers. Modern day taps have an operating torque range which varies between 0.2Nm – 0.4Nm which is based on ergonomic design factors such as comfort and wide spectrum of users (academia.edu). However, a child between the range of 6-9yrs old can easily apply a torque of 1Nm. A middle aged adult can easily apply a torque ranging between 1.5Nm to 7.5Nm (variation on male and female users). Individuals aged above 55 years can comfortably apply a torque ranging between 1.5-3.3Nm. Lack of consciousness about water added to the vast difference between the operating torque of taps and the human muscle potential for generating torque leads to a higher rate of flow of water irrespective of the requirement of the user. We question the tendencies of our instinct  which is a result of consistent practice (habits). This led to the conceptualization of the product which can modify the behavior of the user and form better sustainable habits and practices with regards to water usage through taps.</p>
<p>This simple habit forming device is ideal for anybody who wishes to develop a habit of using less water through taps. Rising water costs in the developed nation can also benefit from using the device by substantially saving up on water taxes from an individual level which seldom helps to boost the morale of our water conscious lifestyle. Bigger organizations can reduce their annual utility bills by installing the accessory in their restroom wash basins.
In this fast paced merciless world, we cannot assume to generate more focus for ordinary activities like
turning on a tap, but what if your wash basin reminded you to check your flow every time you turned it on subconsciously? What if our instincts carried a tendency to use a reduced flow of water while using a tap? What if we re-learn to use the tap again!</p>
